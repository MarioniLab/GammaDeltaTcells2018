# Gamma/Delta T cell project

This repository contains code to perform alignment, counting and downstream analysis of data generated on gamma delta T cells from young and old animals.

* [Preprocessing](../master/Preprocessing/) contains a Makefile to map sequencing reads stored in paired end .fastq to the mouse genome and formulas to align these files for clonotype analysis.

* [Figures](../master/Figures/) contains scripts that reproduce the final figures for the paper.

* [Analysis](../master/Analysis) contains extra scripts to perform data analysis.
